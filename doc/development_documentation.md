# File Sorter

## Final Goal

Have a program that receives a directory and can access to a set of rules it will use to sort the dir

I want the rules to have some sort of syntax

I also want to try to learn a new programming language, I have chosen Rust

I would also like it to be able to download it as a "zsh_package"? Not sure if that is a thing, but we will see
